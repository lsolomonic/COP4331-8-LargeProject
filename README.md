## COP4331-8 Large Project: VibeCheck

### Overview
VibeCheck is a web and mobile app that lets the user pinpoint their favorite on or off-campus locations to study, hang out, or maybe both! You can add custom locations down to whatever level of specificity you desire. If you have a favorite study room in the library you want to remember the number of, a low-key coffee shop you wouldn't want to forget, or whatever other locations you care to store, VibeCheck will serve your needs. 

### Technology
Using the Google Maps React API, VibeCheck allows users to browse any location they'd like with high accuracy. The users' information is stored securly in a MongoDB database with password hashing to ensure safety, and email verification ensures that nobody will be posing as you on VibeCheck.
